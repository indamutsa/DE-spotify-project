# End To End Spotify Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This project implements a cloud-based data warehousing solution using AWS services to ingest, transform, and visualize data. It leverages the scalable and secure storage options of S3, the serverless data integration service AWS Glue for ETL processes, and the interactive query service AWS Athena for querying data directly in S3. Visualization and business intelligence insights are provided through AWS QuickSight.

## Architecture

The project's data flow architecture is as follows:

1. **S3 Staging Area**: Raw data is initially uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket serving as the staging area.
2. **AWS Glue ETL**: AWS Glue jobs are triggered to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis and store it in another S3 bucket designated as the data warehouse.
3. **S3 Data Warehouse**: Transformed data is stored in a structured and query-optimized format.
4. **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: Metadata about the stored data is cataloged to facilitate discovery and querying.
5. **AWS Athena**: Allows SQL-based querying of the data stored in S3 using the metadata defined in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
6. **AWS QuickSight**: Connects to Athena as a data source to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for business intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Basic understanding of AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight)
- Knowledge of SQL and ETL processes
- The dataset is available at [Spotify Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023).

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. S3 Setup

- **Create S3 Buckets**: One for the staging area and another for the data warehouse.
- **Permissions**: Ensure proper IAM roles and policies are in place for access management.

### 2. AWS Glue ETL

- **Create Glue Jobs**: Define and configure ETL jobs to transform data from the staging area and load it into the data warehouse.
- **Crawler Setup**: Configure AWS Glue Crawlers to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with metadata.

### 3. AWS Athena Configuration

- **Setup**: Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the data source.
- **Query Data**: Write SQL queries to analyze the transformed data stored in S3.

### 4. AWS QuickSight Integration

- **DataSource**: Connect QuickSight to Athena.
- **Visualize**: Create dashboards and visualizations based on the data.

## Usage

Detail the steps for running ETL jobs, querying data with Athena, and creating visualizations in QuickSight.

## Security Considerations

- Manage access using IAM roles and policies.
- Enable encryption for data at rest in S3 and in transit.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring Glue jobs and S3 access logs for auditing.

## Cost Management

- Monitor and optimize costs associated with AWS services used in this project.

## Best Practices

- Data partitioning in S3 for efficient querying.
- Regularly update Glue Crawlers for accurate metadata.
- Use cost optimization techniques for Athena and QuickSight.
